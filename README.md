## üíé About

Retreives search results from [judyrecords](https://judyrecords.com) and extract data.

This is why we recommend using this tool as a supplement to and not replacement for manually reviewing results of a judyrecords search. For more information about the terms of judyrecords, see [terms](https://judyrecords.com/terms).

Please use this tool ethically by respecting people's privacy and only collecting intelligence where explicit permission has been granted or otherwise legally qualified to do so. We are not responsible for any illegal use.
